# Introduction 
Flat shading is a basic technique used in computer graphics to render three-dimensional objects. In flat shading, each polygon of an object is rendered with a single color, typically based on the color of its surface. This means that all points on a polygon receive the same color, regardless of their position relative to the light source or other factors. While simple and computationally efficient, flat shading can produce a faceted appearance, especially on curved surfaces, due to the lack of shading gradients across the polygons. (ChatGPt)
